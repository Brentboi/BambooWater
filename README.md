# Bamboo Water
Bamboo Water is a project for COGS 120/CSE 170, a course at UCSD. It's a mobile web application intended to help elderly people keep track of their fiber/water intake. The application is made using HTML/CSS/Javascript, it has a mock-login system (So you don't really need to make an account, but you must enter something!!!) and uses local storage as a means to store the user's data.

(NOTE: Optimized for mobile, it looks pretty bad otherwise)

Hosted on github pages: https://Brentboi.github.io/BambooWater

    3. To add from the database simply click on one of the items in the search result a window should pop up and if you choose to add it to the database click the button and it should be added to your log on the homepage.
4. Profile Page

    2. These help the app determine what goal of fiber and water intake the user should have based off these characteristics.

    2. It automatically updates at midnight each night if there is anything in their logs.
